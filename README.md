# chisel
Markdown to HTML converter

I followed this [spec](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown) to build my project!

## Delete "my_output.html"

Then do the following:

    $ ruby ./lib/chisel.rb my_input.md my_output.html

You will get a terminal prompt as so:

    Converted my_input.md (29 lines) to my_output.html (47 lines)

### Once you get the idea: 

Feel free to mess around with the "my_input.md" file and see what happens!
